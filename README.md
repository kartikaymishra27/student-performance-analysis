# Student Performance Analysis 📊

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes student academic performance to understand how
study habits and attendance impact overall results. The goal is to
identify patterns between study hours, attendance, and subject-wise
scores using basic data science techniques.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze the relationship between study hours and student performance
- Evaluate the impact of attendance on academic results
- Identify top and low-performing students
- Present insights using simple visualizations

## 🧾 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of student records with the following attributes:
- Study Hours (hours studied per day)
- Attendance Percentage
- Mathematics Score
- Science Score
- English Score

Each row represents one student, and each column represents a specific
academic attribute.
